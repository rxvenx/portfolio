#Hey, you! 

ðŸŒŸ I'm a web developer who is currently learning how to code and <i> (trying to) </i> studying both frontend and backend development.

ðŸ“š To intensify my learning, I'm following a schedule where I alternate between studying frontend and backend on different days and using various online resources to supplement my learning.

ðŸš€ In this repository, you'll find my practice projects and code snippets as I progress in my learning journey.

ðŸ’¬ I'm always interested in connecting with other web developers who are learning and growing in this field.

ðŸ“§ Feel free to reach out to me through email or social media if you have any questions or suggestions.
