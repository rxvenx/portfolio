<h1> Hey, you!  </h1>

ğŸŒŸ I'm a wannabe web developer who just decided to learn how to code;

ğŸ–– Don't know yet if I'm a server or client side <i> kind of person </i>, so I'm studying both <i>(trust me, it's working)</i>;

ğŸ“š To intensify my learning, I'm following a schedule where I alternate between studying frontend and backend on different days and using various online resources to supplement my learning;

ğŸš€ In this repository, you'll find my practice projects and code snippets as I progress in my learning journey;

ğŸ’¬ I'm always interested in connecting with other web developers who are learning and growing in this field;

ğŸ“§ Feel free to reach out to me through <a href="mailto:h.bozaipo@gmail.com"> email </a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heloisabozaipo"> social media </a> if you have any questions or suggestions;
