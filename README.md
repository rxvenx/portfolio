<h1> Hey, you!  </h1>

🌟 I'm a wannabe web developer who is currently learning how to code and <i> (trying to) </i> studying both frontend and backend development.

📚 To intensify my learning, I'm following a schedule where I alternate between studying frontend and backend on different days and using various online resources to supplement my learning.

🚀 In this repository, you'll find my practice projects and code snippets as I progress in my learning journey.

💬 I'm always interested in connecting with other web developers who are learning and growing in this field.

📧 Feel free to reach out to me through <a href="mailto:h.bozaipo@gmail.com"> email </a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heloisabozaipo"> social media </a> if you have any questions or suggestions.
